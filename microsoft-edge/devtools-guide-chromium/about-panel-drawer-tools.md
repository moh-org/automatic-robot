# About Panel and Drawer tools

The **More Tools** (**+**) menu appears in two places:

*  On the main toolbar at the top of DevTools (where _Panel_ tools usually go).
*  On the **Drawer** toolbar (where _Drawer_ tools usually go).

In Google Chrome DevTools, a given tool can only appear on the main toolbar (Panel tools) or on the Drawer toolbar (Drawer tools).  The Console tool is unique; it can appear either on the main toolbar (as a Panel tool) or on the Drawer toolbar (as a Drawer tool).

The distinction between Panel tools and Drawer tools is less pronounced in Microsoft Edge than in Google Chrome DevTools.  In Microsoft Edge DevTools, any of these tools, whether labelled as a Panel tool or Drawer tool, can be added to either the main toolbar or the Drawer toolbar.

For an overview of all of the Panel tools, Drawer tools, and a few other tools such as the Inspect tool and Device Emulator, see [Microsoft Edge Developer Tools overview](index.md).<!-- see [DevTools overview] -->
