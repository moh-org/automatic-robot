# Simulate device orientation

Complete the following actions to simulate different device orientations from Microsoft Edge DevTools.

<!--todo: update device orientation section when available -->

1.  Select `Control`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows, Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`P` (macOS) to open the **Command Menu**.

       The **Command Menu**
    :::image-end:::

1.  Type `sensors`, choose **Show Sensors**, and select `Enter`.  The **Sensors** tool opens at the bottom of your DevTools window.
1.  From the **Orientation** list, select one of the preset orientations, such as `Portrait upside down`, or choose **Custom orientation** to provide your own exact orientation.

       :::column span="":::
          :::image type="complex" source="../media/device-mode-console-sensors-orientation-portrait-upside-down.msft.png" alt-text="Choose Portrait upside down from the Orientation list" lightbox="../media/device-mode-console-sensors-orientation-portrait-upside-down.msft.png":::
             Choose `Portrait upside down` from the **Orientation** list
          :::image-end:::
       :::column-end:::
       :::column span="":::
          After you choose **Custom orientation**, the `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` fields are enabled.
          <!--To understand how each axis works, navigate to [Alpha][alpha], [Beta][beta], and [Gamma][gamma].  -->
          <!--todo: update links to alpha, beta, and gamma section when available -->
          You are also able to set a custom orientation by dragging the **Orientation Model**.  Hold `Shift` before dragging to rotate along the `alpha` axis.
