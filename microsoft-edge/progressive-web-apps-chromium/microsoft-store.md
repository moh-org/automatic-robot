1.  On the **Packages** prompt, choose the `.msixbundle` and the `.classic.appxbundle` files you generated in the [Package your PWA](#package-your-pwa-for-the-store) section.  
    
After you complete your submission, your app is reviewed, typically within between 24 and 48 hours.  After you receive approval, your PWA is available in the Microsoft Store.  

### Measure usage of your Store-installed PWA

When your PWA is initially launched, if the PWA was installed from the Microsoft Store, Microsoft Edge includes the following `Referer` header with the request for the first navigation of your web app.

```
Referer: app-info://platform/microsoft-store
```

Use this feature to measure distinct traffic from your Store-installed PWA.  Based on the traffic, you can adjust your appâ€™s content to improve the user experience.  This feature is accessible to both client and server code.

This feature was introduced in Microsoft Edge version 91.
