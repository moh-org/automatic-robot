# Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge  

The Web Platform is a collection of technologies used for building webpages.  The technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other open standards.  The Web Platform constantly evolves to improve user experience, security, and privacy.  In some cases, changes may affect the functionality of existing webpages.  For more information about upcoming Chromium project web platform changes, navigate to [Chrome Platform Status Release timeline][ChromestatusFeaturesSchedule].  

Microsoft Edge adopts nearly all of the upstream changes to the web platform from the Chromium project.  The reasons include functionality and compatibility reasons.  Microsoft remains in full control of the Microsoft Edge browser and may defer or reject changes.  The Microsoft Edge team decide if the change benefits browser users.  Feature areas where Microsoft Edge plans to deviate from Chromium changes to timing or behavior are noted in the following table.  The table also highlights high-impact changes that the Microsoft Edge team is tracking.  

Review this article often.  The Microsoft Edge team updates this article as thinking evolves, timelines solidify, and new changes are announced.  

| Change | Stable Channel | Experimentation | Additional information |  
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Disallow synchronous `XmlHttpRequest` in page dismissal | [Chrome+1](#release-comments) \(Edge v83\) |  | This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  Matching Chrome, Microsoft Edge offers a Group Policy to turn off this change until Edge v88.  For more information, including the planned timeline by Google for this change, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry][ChromestatusFeature4664843055398912].  |  
| Display subtle prompt for notification permissions requests | Edge v84 |  | Quiet notification requests display a subtle request icon in the address bar for site notification permissions requested using the `Notifications` or `Push` API, replacing the full or standard permission flyout prompt UI.  This feature is currently enabled for all users.  To opt out of quiet notification requests, navigate to `edge://settings/content/notifications`.  In the future, the Microsoft Edge team may explore re-enabling the full flyout notification prompt in some scenarios.  |  
| Turn off TLS/1.0 and TLS/1.1 | Edge v84 |  |  |  
| Cookies default to `SameSite=Lax` and `SameSite=None-requires-Secure` | [Chrome+1](#release-comments) \(Edge v86\)  | Canary v82, Dev v82 | This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  For more information, including the planned timeline by Google for this change, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry][ChromestatusFeature5088147346030592].  |  
| Referrer Policy: Default to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | [Chrome+1](#release-comments) \(Edge v86\)  | Canary v79, Dev v79 | This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  For more information, including the planned timeline by Google for this change, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry][ChromestatusFeature6251880185331712].  |  
| Deprecate AppCache | [Chrome+1](#release-comments) \(Edge v86\)  |  | This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  For more information, navigate to the [WebDev documentation][WebDevAppCacheRemoval].  The Microsoft rollout schedule for deprecation is planned for one release after Chrome.  Requesting an [AppCache OriginTrial Token][ChromeDevelopersOrigintrialsAppCacheOriginTrial] allows sites to continue to use the deprecated API until Edge v90.  |  
| HTTP authentication disallowed when third-party cookies are blocked  | Edge v87  |  | Starting with Edge v87, when cookies are blocked for third-party requests, using either the [BlockThirdPartyCookies][DeployedgeMicrosoftEdgePoliciesBlockthirdpartycookies] policy or the toggle in `edge://settings`, HTTP authentication is also disallowed. This change may impact Enterprise Mode [Site List downloads for Internet Explorer mode][DeployedgeEdgeIeModePoliciesConfigureUsingUseEnterpriseModeIeWebsiteListPolicy] if the endpoint hosting the list requires the use of HTTP authentication.  To allow the use of both cookies and HTTP authentication for Enterprise Mode Site List downloads, add a matching URL pattern to the [CookiesAllowedForURLs][DeployedgeMicrosoftEdgePoliciesCookiesallowedforurls] policy.  |
| Removal of Adobe Flash | Edge v88  |  | This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  For more information, navigate to the [Adobe Flash Chromium Roadmap][ChromiumFlashRoadmapSupportRemoved].  | 
| Remove FTP support | Edge v88  | Beta v87 | In Edge v88, FTP support is removed entirely.  This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status Entry][ChromestatusFeature6246151319715840].  Enterprises that have sites that still require FTP support can continue to use FTP by configuring the site to use [IE mode][DeployedgeEdgeIeMode].  | 
| Autoupgrade mixed content images | Edge v88  |  | Non-secure \(HTTP\) references to images are automatically upgraded to HTTPS; if the image is not available over HTTPS, the image download fails. A [Group Policy][DeployedgeMicrosoftEdgePoliciesInsecurecontentallowedforurls] is available to control this feature. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry][ChromestatusFeature4926989725073408].  | 
| Removal of 3DES in TLS  | Edge v93  |  | Starting with Edge v93, support for the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite will be removed. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry][ChromestatusFeature6678134168485888]. Additionally, in Edge v93, a compatibility policy will be available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with outdated servers. This compatibility policy will become obsolete and stop working in Edge v95. Ensure that you update affected servers before then. |
| Deprecate WebRTC's Plan B SDP semantics | [Chrome+1](#release-comments) \(TBA\)  |  | This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. This change deprecates a legacy Session Description Protocol (SDP) dialect called Plan B. This SDP format is being replaced by the Unified Plan, which is a spec-compliant and cross-browser compatible SDP format. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry][ChromestatusFeature5823036655665152], [PSA: Timeline for Plan B SDP Deprecation and Removal - Please Migrate to Unified Plan][PSADeprecateWebRTCPlanB], and [PSA: Plan B throwing is limited to Canary in M93 (not throwing in Stable)][PSADeprecateWebRTCPlanBLimitedToCanaryInM93]. The Microsoft rollout schedule for deprecation is planned for one release after Chrome. Requesting a [WebRTC Plan B Reverse Origin Trial Token][ChromeDevelopersOrigintrialsWebRTCPlanBOriginTrial] allows sites to continue to use the deprecated API until Edge v96. |
| Restrict private network requests to secure contexts  | Edge v94  |  | Starting with Edge v94, access to resources on local (intranet) networks from pages on the internet requires that those pages be delivered over HTTPS. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry][ChromestatusFeature5436853517811712]. Two compatibility policies are available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with non-secure pages: [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowed][DeployEdgeMicrosoftEdgePoliciesInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowed] and [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowedForUrls][DeployEdgeMicrosoftEdgePoliciesInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowedForUrls]. |
| Block mixed content downloads | Edge v94  |  | Downloading of files from HTTP URLs will be blocked on HTTPS pages. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  For more information, navigate to the [Google security blog entry][GoogleBlogSecurity20200206]. |
| Removal of cross-origin subframe JavaScript dialogs | [Chrome+1](#release-comments) (Edge v96)  |  | Removes `window.alert`, `window.prompt`, and `window.confirm` from cross-origin iFrames. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based.  For more information, navigate to [Intent to Remove: Cross origin subframe JS Dialogs](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/hTOXiBj3D6A/m/JtkdpDd1BAAJ). |
